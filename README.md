Parses compliant Drivers License/ID Card scan data files using JavaScript.

Node.js and browser compatible!

Never save a drivers license.
It is unlawful in many areas and ALL databases can be hacked.

Generally, there is only one secure way to use DL/ID Card data:
1. To verify the accuracy of information that you have already been provided through manual input.

Even this can be unlawful in many areas and you should check your local laws before attempting it.

Do not store the raw data you obtain from scanning. Use this parser to filter data to only the fields you need and are legally authorized to access.
